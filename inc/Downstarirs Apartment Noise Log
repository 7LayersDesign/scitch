Downstarirs Apartment Noise Log
Primary sound is very loud, booming bass guitar and music. It shakes my floors at the least and on some days shakes my dishes. He has my ZERO effort to be considerate. I have often heard several people down their ALL playing intruments. It sounds as if he plays stereo music and then plays his bass over the music. To do so he turns the bass up. The low frequency resosnates through the walls and floors. I'm sorry but playing a bass at live show levels in an apartment complex is not acceptable. Headphones or fork out for a rehearsal space.

Not to mention he has had a dead Christmas on his patio for 3 MONTHS!!
